% Purpose:  
%      Perform the texture segmentation on texture1.gif
%
% Input Variables:
%      Text_Img           input texture1.gif image
%      
% Returned Results:
%      GaborFilt_Img      image after applying Gabor filter
%      Smooth_Img         smoothing applied on Gabor filtered image output
%      Segment_Img        superimposed segmented image onto the original
%                         image input
%
% Processing Flow:
%      1.  Read the texture1 image and convert into grayscale
%      2.  Apply the Gabor filter with F=0.042, theta=0 & sigma=24 with 
%          the GEF of width ((4*sigma)+1) pixels
%      3.  Apply the Smoothing filter on the Gabor filtered image output 
%          with sigma=24
%      4.  Segment the image with the manually chosen threshold and
%          superimpose the segmented image onto the original image
%
%
% The following functions are called:
%      imread.m            read the image
%      gabor_filt.m        apply Gabor filtering with specified parameters
%                          on a given image
%      smooth_filt.m       smoothen the Gabor filtered image output
%      segment_image.m     segment the smoothed image with certain
%                          threshold and superimpose on the original image
%      imshow.m            displays the image
%      mesh.m              3D plot of the image
