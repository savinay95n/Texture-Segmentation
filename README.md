# Texture-Segmentation

The Objective of this project is two-fold. The first objective is to implement and understand the process of morphological skeletonization as well as reconstruction of the original image using the obtained skeleton. Skeletonization and Reconstruction use morphological operations like opening, erosion, dilation and set operations like union. The second objective is to understand and implement aspects of shape analysis â€“ Size distribution, Pecstrum and Complexity of individual connected components (objects) in a binary image. Pecstral analysis is further used for the application of object matching. The goal of this project is to gain better understanding of the above-mentioned concepts and achieve intended results of skeletonization, reconstruction, shape analysis and object matching through their implementation.
